# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The analysis addresses the significant class imbalance problem typical in fraud detection datasets and develops a robust model to identify fraudulent activities with high precision while minimizing false positives.

## üéØ Project Scope
The analysis covers the complete fraud detection pipeline:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and data cleaning
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding distributions and correlations
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implementing undersampling techniques
- **Model Development**: Building and evaluating multiple machine learning models
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying key predictors of fraudulent transactions
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model effectiveness using appropriate metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **RobustScaler**: For handling outliers in financial data

## üìà Data Exploration

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Rows**: 4,000 transaction records
- **Columns**: 31 attributes (28 anonymized features + Time, Amount, Class)
- **Target Variable**: Class (0: Normal, 1: Fraud)
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced (typical of fraud datasets)

### Key Data Cleaning Steps
- Scaled 'Time' and 'Amount' features using RobustScaler
- Handled potential missing values and duplicates
- Moved target variable to end for clarity
- Prepared data for machine learning algorithms

### Core Metrics Calculated
- Fraud Percentage: 0.6% (typical imbalance for fraud detection)
- Top Correlated Features: Identified V4, V11 (positive), V14, V17 (negative)
- Model Performance: Logistic Regression achieved strong detection capabilities

## üìã Analysis Highlights

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Applied RobustScaler to handle outliers in 'Time' and 'Amount' features
- Maintained anonymized features (V1-V28) which are PCA-transformed for privacy
- Ensured proper data formatting for machine learning algorithms

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Identified strong positive correlations: V4 (0.43), V11 (0.35) with fraud
- Identified strong negative correlations: V14 (-0.41), V17 (-0.33) with fraud
- Created visualizations to understand feature relationships

### 3. Class Imbalance Handling
- Implemented strategic undersampling of majority class
- Balanced training data to improve model sensitivity to fraud patterns
- Maintained original test set distribution for realistic evaluation

### 4. Model Development
- Built Logistic Regression model with balanced class weighting
- Achieved strong performance metrics on imbalanced test data
- Generated probability scores for nuanced fraud detection

### 5. Feature Importance
- V4 identified as strongest positive predictor of fraud
- V14 identified as strongest negative predictor (protective factor)
- Comprehensive feature importance analysis guided model interpretation

## üéØ Project Conclusion
The credit card fraud analysis achieved several key outcomes:
1. **Effective Data Preparation**: Successfully handled the unique challenges of financial transaction data
2. **Imbalance Management**: Implemented appropriate sampling techniques for rare fraud detection
3. **Strong Model Performance**: Developed a model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions
4. **Actionable Insights**: Identified key features that signal fraudulent activity
5. **Robust Framework**: Established a reproducible pipeline for fraud detection
