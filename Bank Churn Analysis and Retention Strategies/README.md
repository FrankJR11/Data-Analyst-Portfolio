# Bank Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

## Brief Background

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. In the banking industry, customer churn represents a significant challenge as acquiring new customers is typically 5-25 times more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of bank customers to identify key factors influencing churn and develop data-driven retention strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of customer churn patterns using a dataset containing 10,000 bank customers with 13 demographic and financial attributes. The goal is to identify at-risk customers, understand churn drivers, and recommend targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition rates.

**Dataset**: 10,000 customer records with 13 features including demographics, account information, and churn status

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Comprehensive examination of dataset quality and distributions
- **Feature Analysis**: Correlation between customer attributes and churn behavior
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Identification of high-risk customer segments
- **Predictive Insights**: Key drivers of customer churn
- **Retention Strategy**: Data-driven recommendations for customer retention
